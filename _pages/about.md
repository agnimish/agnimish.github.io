Hey there, I am Nimish. I am a final year undergrad who believes in the Art of googling :), and will be happy to collaborate with you on any interesting project.

During my first year of engineering, I got interested in programming, Since then, Iâ€™ve been working to improve my coding skills while shutting several bugs up!. I have recently developed interest in the field of Machine Learning and related applications, as I try to do some interesting stuff with it!

Apart from that, I like watching movies mostly suspense thrillers, and have a keen interest in problem solving. When not staring at some code, you can find me hanging out with friends and enjoying life in general.
